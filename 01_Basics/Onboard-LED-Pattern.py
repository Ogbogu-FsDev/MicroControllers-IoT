# ===========================
# Onboard LED Speed Pattern Demo
# Description:
#   This script demonstrates how to blink an onboard LED
#   on a Raspberry Pi Pico at different speeds:
#   fast, medium, and slow â€” cycling through each pattern
#   continuously.
#
#   It shows how to use functions, loops, and GPIO control
#   in MicroPython for simple timing-based tasks.
